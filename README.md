# Recipe Tagger

This library provides a classification and tagging system for ingredients and recipes. 
The functioning of the library is based on a dataset containing more than 700 ingredients mapped with their own class. 

An ingredient could be classified in one of the following class: 
- Vegetable
- Fruit
- Legume
- Meat
- Egg
- Diary
- Staple
- Condiment
- Nut
- Seafood

A recipe is tagged based on its ingredients class. 
The library also provides a function to get the class percentage of recipe ingredients.
